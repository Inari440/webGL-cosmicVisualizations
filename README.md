## Features

- **3D Visualization**: Create stunning 3D graphics with ease.
- **Fractal Generation**: Generate complex fractals in real-time.
- **Particle Simulation**: Simulate cosmic particles with realistic physics.
- **GLSL Shaders**: Utilize the power of shaders for advanced visual effects.
- **High Performance**: Leverage GPU rendering for smooth animations.
- **Interactive**: Engage users with interactive visualizations.

## Installation

To get started, download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Inari440/webGL-cosmicVisualizations/releases). Follow these steps:

1. Download the ZIP file from the release.
2. Extract the contents to your preferred directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

You can also clone the repository using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Inari440/webGL-cosmicVisualizations.git
cd webGL-cosmicVisualizations
```

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the framework. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the default example. You can modify the JavaScript code in the `script.js` file to create your own visualizations.

### Basic Structure

The framework consists of the following main components:

- **HTML**: The structure of your visualization.
- **CSS**: Styles for your visual elements.
- **JavaScript**: Logic to handle rendering and interactions.

### Example Code

Here is a simple example to get you started:

```javascript
// Initialize WebGL context
const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
const gl = canvas.getContext('webgl');

// Set clear color
gl.clearColor(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
gl.clear(gl.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

// Your rendering code here
```

Feel free to explore the `examples` folder for more complex implementations.

## Examples

The repository includes several examples demonstrating the capabilities of the framework. You can find them in the `examples` directory. Each example showcases different features, such as:

- **Fractal Zoom**: Explore intricate fractal patterns.
- **Particle System**: Visualize particle movements and interactions.
- **Raymarching**: Create stunning visual effects using raymarching techniques.

You can run each example by opening the corresponding HTML file in your browser.
